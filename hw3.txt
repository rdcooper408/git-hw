Homework #3

1) Read PCFB Chapter 3 and do the example on page 32 and 33. This one will take at least two steps so take a screen shot of your regex and the output for each step to show your work. The LatLon.txt file is in the pcfb examples folder.

2) Use the column selection trick on pcfb p34 to rearrange the columns in the columns_test.csv folder (in lecture_pdfs/regex_files) re try it out. Do the following: 

a) change order to: institution, catalog, species, lat, long 

b)change delimiter from comma to tab
