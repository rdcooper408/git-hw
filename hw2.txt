Homework #2

#we want to look at the first 3 lines of the 407228326.fasta file
head -n3 407228326.fasta

#look at all but the first line
tail -n+2 407228326.fasta

##count the sequence length
#remove the first line and the end of line characters
tail -n+2 407228326.fasta | tr -d "\n"
#add on wc -c to count the number of characters
tail -n+2 407228326.fasta | tr -d "\n" | wc -c

#Do for other files
tail -n+2 407228412.fasta | tr -d "\n" | wc -c
tail -n+2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d "\n" | wc -c

#Count matches of ATGC in E. coli genome
#remove first line 
#remove newline characters 
#use grep to print out all occurrences of the sequence
#count all occurrences
tail -n+2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d "\n" | grep -o "ATGC" | wc -l

#compute the AT/GC ratio
tail -n+2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d "\n" | grep -o [A,T] | wc -l
tail -n+2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d "\n" | grep -o [C,G] | wc -l

####DARWIN####

#1
#remove the first 264 lines
#remove lines 13900 onward
#save results in darwin.txt
head -n 13900 otoos10.txt | tail -n+265 > darwin.txt

#2
#Count occurrences of "evolution" or "evolved" -c
#full words only
#ignore case -i
grep -i -c "evolution\|evolved" darwin.txt

#3
#Count the occurrences of "natural selection" and "Wallace"
grep -i -c "natural selection\|Wallace" darwin.txt
grep -i -c "natural selection" darwin.txt
grep -i -c "Wallace" darwin.txt

#Save all the commands in a text file
echo "Occurrences of \"Evolution\" or \"Evolved\"" > jnotardarwingrep.txt
grep -i -c "evolution\|evolved" darwin.txt >> jnotardarwingrep.txt
echo "Occurrences of \"Natural Selection OR Wallace\"" >> jnotardarwingrep.txt
grep -i -c "natural selection\|Wallace" darwin.txt >> jnotardarwingrep.txt
echo "Occurrences of \"Natural Selection\"" >> jnotardarwingrep.txt

cat jnotardarwingrep.txt

####TEMPERATURES####

#Extract the maximum temperature of each station for Jan 1st
#TMAX
#18000101 
grep -r "180[0-3]0101,TMAX," 
grep "180.0101,TMAX," 180[0-3].csv

#Write a one-line command that gives the warmest temp. for a given day of 1800
grep "18000205,TMAX,.*.,,,E" 1800.csv | cut -d "," -f 2,4 | sort | tail -n +2
grep "18000505,TMAX,.*.,,,E" 1800.csv | cut -d "," -f 2,4 | sort | tail -n +2
